# Patches applied by DevTools

## March 2025: disconnect patch [crbug.com/406729910]

As part of the exploration into the 30s timeouts on CQ bots, we have applied a patch to the Karma library to avoid creating timeouts when the state is already disconnected.

This is suggested in https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/3852.

The patch is already applied to DevTools and committed. If you want to remove it, you can run:

```
git apply -R devtools_disconnect_patch.patch
```
